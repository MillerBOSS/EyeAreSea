## 📞 **For Claude Code Future Sessions**

**Quick Start Commands**:
```bash
# Check build environment
./dev-setup.sh status

# Ensure development environment
./dev-setup.sh dev

# Verify git identity
git config --local user.name  # Should show: MillerBOSS

# Test build
xcodebuild -workspace Textual.xcworkspace -scheme "Textual (Standard Release)" -configuration Release clean build
```

**Important Notes for AI**:
- User is a **beginner** - explain build processes clearly
- **Privacy critical** - never leak personal Apple Developer info
- Repository owner is **MillerBOSS** - use this identity for all git operations
- Always use **development environment** unless specifically building for distribution
- **Build verification required** - always test that builds work after changes
