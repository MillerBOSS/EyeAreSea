# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Textual is a macOS IRC client written in Objective-C with some Swift components. Originally forked from LimeChat in 2010, it's developed by Codeux Software. The project is no longer being actively maintained as of the README notice.

## Build System and Commands

### Building the Application
- **Primary Build Target**: Use the "Standard Release" build scheme in Xcode
- **Workspace File**: `Textual.xcworkspace` (use this instead of individual .xcodeproj files)
- **Minimum Requirements**: Xcode 10.0+ on macOS High Sierra (Swift 4.2 requirement)

### Code Signing Configuration
- **CRITICAL**: Never modify code signing settings through Xcode UI
- Edit `Configurations/Build/Code Signing Identity.xcconfig` to configure code signing
- A valid code signing certificate is required (doesn't need to be Apple-issued)
- Turning off code signing is highly discouraged as features depend on sandboxing

### License Management
- Set `TEXTUAL_BUILT_WITH_LICENSE_MANAGER=0` in `Configurations/Build/Standard Release/Enabled Features.xcconfig` if building without a license key
- This disables trial mode licensing code at build time

### Submodules
The project uses Git submodules. When cloning:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Codeux-Software/Textual.git
cd Textual
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **Main Application**: `Sources/App/` - Primary Textual application
- **XPC Services**: Modular services handling specific functionality:
  - Historic Log File Manager
  - IRC Remote Connection Manager
  - Inline Content Loader (with Core Media extension)

### Key Controllers
- **TXMasterController**: Central application controller
- **TXWindowController**: Window management
- **TXMenuController**: Menu system management
- **TXAppearance**: UI appearance and theming
- **IRCClient**: Core IRC client functionality
- **IRCWorld**: Global IRC state management

### File Organization
- `Sources/App/Classes/Controllers/`: Application-level controllers
- `Sources/App/Classes/Dialogs/`: UI dialogs and sheets
- `Sources/App/Classes/Headers/`: Public header files
- `Sources/App/Classes/Headers/Internal/`: Internal implementation headers
- `Sources/App/Classes/Headers/Private/`: Private API headers
- `Configurations/Build/`: Build configuration files (.xcconfig)

### Build Configuration System
The project uses an extensive .xcconfig system for build configuration:
- `Configurations/Build/Common/`: Shared configuration
- `Configurations/Build/Standard Release/`: Release build settings
- `Configurations/Build/Debug/`: Debug build settings
- Feature flags in `Enabled Features.xcconfig` control compilation of optional features

### Key Features (Configurable)
- Sandbox environment support (TEXTUAL_BUILT_INSIDE_SANDBOX)
- Advanced encryption (TEXTUAL_BUILT_WITH_ADVANCED_ENCRYPTION)
- License management (TEXTUAL_BUILT_WITH_LICENSE_MANAGER)
- Sparkle auto-updates (TEXTUAL_BUILT_WITH_SPARKLE_ENABLED)

## Plugin and Extension System
- Supports plugins in Objective-C & Swift
- Supports scripts in AppleScript and other languages
- CSS/HTML/JavaScript style customization
- Documentation available at help.codeux.com for writing plugins and scripts

## Claude Code Integration

### Required System Tools
Claude Code requires these tools to work effectively with this project:

#### Essential Build Tools
- **Xcode**: Full Xcode installation (currently 26.0.1) with command line tools
- **xcodebuild**: Used for building all targets and schemes
- **git**: For version control and submodule management
- **bash**: For build scripts and general system operations

#### Available Build Schemes (from `xcodebuild -list -workspace Textual.xcworkspace`)
- **Textual (Standard Release)** - Primary release build (recommended for development)
- **Textual (Debug)** - Debug configuration
- **Textual (Standard Release Sandboxed)** - Sandboxed release build
- **Textual (App Store)** - App Store distribution build
- **Build Frameworks** - Builds all framework dependencies
- Various XPC Services and Extensions (see workspace listing)

### Build Commands

#### Standard Development Build
```bash
xcodebuild -workspace Textual.xcworkspace -scheme "Textual (Standard Release)" -configuration Release clean build
```

#### Debug Build
```bash
xcodebuild -workspace Textual.xcworkspace -scheme "Textual (Debug)" -configuration Debug clean build
```

#### Build All Frameworks First (if needed)
```bash
xcodebuild -workspace Textual.xcworkspace -scheme "Build Frameworks" clean build
```

### Security Considerations for Claude Code
- **Code Signing**: Never modify code signing settings programmatically
- **Submodules**: Initialized and managed through git commands only
- **Build Artifacts**: Generated files are excluded from repository
- **Sensitive Data**: No API keys, certificates, or credentials should be handled by Claude
- **Repository Scope**: Operations limited to MillerBOSS/EyeAreSea repository only

### Project Structure for Claude Operations
When making changes, Claude should focus on:
- `Sources/App/Classes/` - Main application logic
- `Sources/Shared/` - Shared components
- `Configurations/Build/` - Build configuration (with extreme caution)
- Documentation files (*.md)
- GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/`)

### Testing and Validation
After any code changes:
1. Run clean build with Standard Release scheme
2. Verify no build errors or warnings introduced
3. Check that all submodules remain properly initialized
4. Ensure no sensitive files are staged for commit

### Development vs Production Environments

**IMPORTANT**: Use the environment setup script for proper builds:

#### Development Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# Switch to development environment (no Apple Developer cert required)
./dev-setup.sh dev

# Now build in Xcode GUI or CLI
xcodebuild -workspace Textual.xcworkspace -scheme "Textual (Standard Release)" -configuration Release clean build
```

#### Production Environment (Distribution only)
```bash
# Switch to production environment (requires Apple Developer cert)
./dev-setup.sh prod
```

#### Check Current Environment
```bash
./dev-setup.sh status
```

**Verified Build Results (2025-09-25):**
- âœ… Universal binary (x86_64 + arm64)
- âœ… Complete app bundle with frameworks and XPC services
- âœ… All submodules properly integrated
- âœ… No compilation errors in development environment
- âœ… Works in both Xcode GUI and CLI
- âœ… Build artifacts in: `Build Results/Release/Textual.app`

**Privacy & Anonymity Confirmed:**
- Git identity set to: MillerBOSS <MillerBOSS@users.noreply.github.com>
- No personal Apple Developer info leaked to repository
- Development builds work without any Apple Developer account

**System Requirements:**
- macOS with Xcode 26.0.1+
- Git with submodule support
- No Apple Developer certificate required for development builds
