# Mac App Store Distribution & Licensing

## üìù **BSD License Compliance for App Store**

### **What's Required for Mac App Store:**

1. **Attribution**: Must include original copyright notices
2. **License Text**: Include full BSD license text in app bundle
3. **No Endorsement**: Cannot use original developer names for marketing
4. **Apple Requirements**: Standard App Store guidelines apply

### **Specific Steps for EyeAreSea:**

#### **1. Attribution Requirements**
- [x] **Keep Copyright Notices**: All existing copyright headers in source files
- [ ] **Credits Screen**: Add "About" section crediting Codeux Software and original Textual
- [ ] **License File**: Include original license text in app bundle

#### **2. App Store Technical Requirements**
- [ ] **Sandboxing**: App must be properly sandboxed (currently has issues)
- [ ] **Code Signing**: Must use valid Apple Developer certificate
- [ ] **Modern APIs**: All deprecated API warnings should be resolved
- [ ] **Privacy**: Declare all data usage and network access

#### **3. Legal Considerations**
- ‚úÖ **BSD License Allows**: Commercial distribution with attribution
- ‚úÖ **Fork Rights**: Can modify and distribute under new name
- ‚ùì **Trademark**: "Textual" name cannot be used (hence "EyeAreSea")
- ‚ùì **Icons/Assets**: May need original artwork or new designs

### **Original Textual License (BSD-Style)**
Based on source code headers and documentation, Textual uses a modified BSD license that:
- Allows redistribution and modification
- Requires copyright notice preservation
- Prohibits using names for endorsement
- Grants broad usage rights

### **Recommended Actions Before App Store Submission:**

1. **Legal Review**: Have lawyer review BSD compliance
2. **Create Attribution Page**: Proper credit to original developers
3. **Asset Audit**: Ensure all artwork/icons are legally clear
4. **Privacy Policy**: Required for App Store submission
5. **App Description**: Cannot imply official relationship with Textual

### **Revenue Sharing Requirements:**
**None** - BSD license does not require revenue sharing or royalties to original developers. However, proper attribution and respect for the original project is both legally required and ethically important.

## üéØ **Bottom Line**

**Yes, you can sell EyeAreSea on the Mac App Store** provided you:
1. Include proper attribution to original Textual developers
2. Meet Apple's technical requirements (sandboxing, modern APIs)
3. Don't use Textual trademarks or imply official relationship
4. Follow standard App Store guidelines

The BSD license is specifically designed to allow this type of commercial use.
